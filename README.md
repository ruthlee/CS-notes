# Notes for a Computer Enthusiast
I'm a student studying applied math in university, who has recently found out about the wonderful world of programming (especially in the context of machine learning) and wants to get in on the action. I've realized that keeping good notes about the things I read about on the Internet is paramount for success in this mission, so here I'm hoping I can keep a log of the things I learn about while traversing the web. 

## Topics
So far, here are the topics of interest:

1. Computer fundamentals: shell, unix, etc.
1. Workflow efficiency stuff like vim
1. Programming (especially in C)
1. Machine learning stuff (which kicked off this notebook thing to begin with)

Hopefully this will be useful to me and others as the repository grows with notes!
